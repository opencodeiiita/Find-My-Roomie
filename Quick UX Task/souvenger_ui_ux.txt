----------------------------Whatsapp-Features----------------------------------

1.The best part of whatsapp home screen is that the recent chats/new messages are on the top of the chat list.
  Also number of messages shown in the right side of the screen helps a lot to the users to see the 
  most important msgs among the all new msgs.
2.The pin feature on the home screen is one of the best feature which helps to pin the important grps or friends on the 
  top.So that none of ur important stuffs goes down.
3.The feature to set display picture (DP) is very usefule to identify another person or the important grps that u joined 
  and helps to quickly identify the grp/person who messeged.Imagine what if there were no DP feature ..all friends/grps looks
  similar and its just burdensome task to identify by the names of the grps. 
  Obviously beacuse we can identify images more quickly then texts.

---------------------------Suggestions------------------------------------------

1.The last msg which u sent or recieved is also visible in the home screen which can be read by 
  even other when ur sharing screen to some one, so it must be kept private/ hidden or visible only after 
  opening the chat window of a particular friend.
2.The feature to add anyone in a grp without asking is very bad feature.So a msg must be given to whom u r adding
  in a grp and only if he accepts then only u can add.
