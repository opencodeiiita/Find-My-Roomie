**WhatsApp**

Reviews:
> Pinned chats are easily available at the top of launcher activity of whatsApp.
> Whenever we post any status, there always comes an option to share the same post to facebook. This really helps whenever we need to give event updates.
> Easy user interface  

Suggestions :
> In a group, there should be everyone tag and a feature through which we can add our friends and tag them collectively whenever needed rather tagging each of them everytime.
> Pinned chats should be visible in WhatsApp web also.
> There is a section for writing any text in status, it has very limited options for background and fonts so, this should be improved.
