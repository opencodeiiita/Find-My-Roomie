Views About Whatsapp home screen

1. The chat section is maintained very nicely, showing the new chats at the top and also the pinned chats (which are most important at the top).
2. The button at the bottom - right is placed efficiently because of its less frequent use.
3. You can block and report any contact which you feel is using any abusive language or sending promotional advertisements.
5. It distinctly shows the call logs with proper date and time.
4. My suggestions:
    - I think the camera option in the top-left is quite useless as people always prefer to take pictures from their phone's camera.
    - We cannot share aur screens during the calls, unlike discord which provides this facility. This feature could aslo be added to Whatsapp.
