Whatsapp Home Screen 

Features which i like:- 

- when we  open whatsapp, we get chats ,calls and status on the top. so that anyone can directly go to where we exactly want to go.

- when someone saw your text it appears blue which is very good thing however you can also change this setting.

- Whatsapp messages are protected by end-to-end encryption so that we are secured that our massages aren't going anywhere else than the person which we are talking to.

- Whatsapp has a simple and clean interface .

Suggestions :-

- The group limit should be increase so that we can add more and more peoples together.

- Video calls with multiple people feature can be improved.

- We have options to mute some chats for sometimes so that not got annoyed by random spamming.
