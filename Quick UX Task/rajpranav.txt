Reasons why Whatsapp Home Screen loolks like the way it is:-
 
 - when we open whatsapp it has three options at the top chat,status and calls which is to provide ease to user so that what they want can select it easily.
 - The top 3 cahts are pinned (depens on the user) which are the important chat which user not want to miss in any situation.
 -Also home screen hai three dots on the top right which helps to choose the things like setting which can be easily accesible.

Suggestions which i want to propose :-

- there should be @eveyone tag like discord so that you don't have to tag every person by its name.
-there should be option to mute personal chats so that we can sray away from the non-important massages currently (we can read it when we want).
