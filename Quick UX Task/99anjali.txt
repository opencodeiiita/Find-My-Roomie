1.Broadcast message(dont want to share anyone info with anyone).. Once we selected the people for a broadcast group it appears at the top of the screen which is a good thing and helps to save time that we dont have to select 100 people again and again to send a same message to all.

if this was not there then everytime we have to select the people and send the message which is quiet time consuming and irritating. 





Suggestions:


1.Archive chats.. what happens in this is whenever we archive someone if they messaged us then the chats become normal so there is no use of doing archive hence there could be a feature that until we unarchive it person name should not appear in the screen.
