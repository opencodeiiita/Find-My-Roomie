Reviews on Whatsapp

1.Voice Recording Option at the bottom right in chats is a very nice thing .As it is at the messaging area ,person could easily see and use it and send the voice note to their friends.
if it was not there then the person who have issues in writing a message can not send message and talk .

2.Pinned Chats ...Most Useful thing in the homescreen ,We can pin important discussion at the top of the screen so that It should not be missed because of spamming .

If it would not be there then it may happen that we can miss our important chats because of spamming.



Suggestions:

1..Archive chats.. what happens in this is whenever we archive someone if they messaged us then the chats become normal so there is no use of doing archive hence there could be a feature that until we unarchive it person name should not appear in the screen.

If it would be there then we can archive some unwanted msg from anyone which we dont want.

2. There can be a direct option to change the display picture at the top of the home screen as of now we have to follow(go) 5 steps to change our display picture.So the person who is not so tech can face some issue. According to me adding this feature can make whatsapp more user friendly.
