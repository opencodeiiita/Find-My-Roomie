2. For the home screen issues the chats arrangement is cool but the updates like archives on top may have some issues for some users and it must be like a button in the left bottom most area.
3. Currently front screen have 3 parallel areas namely CHATS, STATUS and CALLS which can be in a way like CHATS, GROUPS, STATUS and CALLS which can make easier for user to differentiate between chats and groups
4. The camera must be a button on the left upper corner opening  without sliding the screen it is sometimes difficult for users to use whatsapp with one hand.
