A good thing about homescreen is you could pin 3 chats which are important for you. You dont need to scroll
them and find them. They are available for you at the top. 
Another is it provides quite easy handling. NOt much complexities

suggestion
Archived chat must be at end, it comes ath the top and creates chaos.
We add those chats to archive which we dont neee right now so it must appear at end.
It will of great advantage according to me and will be good for user
