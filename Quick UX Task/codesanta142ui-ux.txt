It provides great privacy and security to a users. If u receive any wrong messages or some thing abusive u can report the user. Its ur wish 
to whom u want to show your pictures , last seen and status. So its the best thing for a user.

The chats that are muted by the person must be below all the unread messages.
As the person mutes as he doesnt want them to read at that moment.
So it will increase user level experience.

3 suggestion
Archived chat must be at end, it comes ath the top and creates chaos.
We add those chats to archive which we dont neee right now so it must appear at end.
It will of great advantage according to me and will be good for user
