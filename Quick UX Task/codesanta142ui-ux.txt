1st suggestion
When a person is in hurry he/she needs to unread the messages to read them later or such. But these steps take time delay 
or several options to be clicked. So it can be done with less time with one click and collapse all the unread chats or starred chats.

2nd suggestion
Archived chat must be at end, it comes ath the top and creates chaos.
We add those chats to archive which we dont neee right now so it must appear at end.
It will of great advantage according to me.
