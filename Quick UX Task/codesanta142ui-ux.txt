1st suggestion
If a option persists to tag the message as important, 
those unread messages must come first. When we have abundant of messages
these important ones sometime get missed nad can cause a serious issue.

2nd suggestion
Archived chat must be at end, it comes ath the top and creates chaos
We add those chats to archive which we dont neee right now so it must appear at end
