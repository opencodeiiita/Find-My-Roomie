Whatsapp has one of the best UI/UX experience.

Some features i like:-
1)Frequently forwarded tags on messages which are forwarded by multiple user help us to identify spam messages
2) The toggle between light and dark mode is amazing
3) Allowing to add customizable background is a good feature 
4) Allowing to pin chats helps us to keep the most important chats on top

Some changed i would like to propose:-
1)The search button is at the top. Most people use whatsapp single handedly and that button isn't reachable on big phones. I would like to change its location to somewhere near the bottom.
2)Allowing to assign roles and the @everyone tag in whatsapp group chats.
