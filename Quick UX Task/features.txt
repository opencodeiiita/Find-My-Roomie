Whatsapp features

1. Whatsapp home screen has positioned their elements nearly perfectly.
  a. The search button is positioned so that one can access it while using just one hand.
  b. The menu button is positioned in a similar fashion.
  c. The chat is sorted accordance to the recent activity. The pin feature is great through which you can fix some chats at the top but I would prefer if the limit on pinned chats is relaxed.

2. The swipe transition through the chats, status and call section makes thing really easy otherwise it would have been very difficult to access those sections.

3. I feel there should be an option to allow unread chats at the top. There is a lot of times the unread chats are simply missed.
