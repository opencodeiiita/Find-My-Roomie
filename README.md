# Find My Roomie 👬 App Design
For developing an app, it is essential to know the importance of UI/UX in the mobile app📱. You can create an app with great functionality but if you fail to focus on the designing part, it may lead to the downfall of your app. It is mandatory to have the right balance between the functionality and UI/UX of the app in order to make it a successful one✅. Do you have what it takes?

## ✒Tech Stack:

- FigJam
- Figma/Adobe XD
- Illustrator

</br>

## 🧾Common Rules:

- The repository is divided into several tasks. **Each task will be opened subsequently for a limited amount of time and all the submissions have to be made within those allotted days only.** NO submission will be accepted after the allotted time ends. The details for the specific tasks and the time allotted for each can be found in their specific folders.
- The submissions will be judged by the mentors and points will be allotted by them for each particular task based on various aspects and intricacies of design like design thinking process, originality of the idea, visual appeal of the submission, etc. The points will be distributed as follows:


    🥇1st Place :   Full Points
    
    🥈2nd Place :   0.8 * Full Points
    
    🥉3rd Place :   0.5 * Full Points
    

Since everyone should be awarded for their efforts, the rest of the participants who qualify for the **Minimum Design Criteria (MDC)** as mentioned in the respective folders of the task will be awarded 0.3 * Full Points🎉.

> ALL THE FINAL DECISIONS FOR THE JUDGMENT AND AWARDING OF POINTS ⚖️ BASED ON THE SUBMISSION RESIDE WITH THE MENTORS. 
> No claim can be made on the number of points awarded by the Mentors🙂.
